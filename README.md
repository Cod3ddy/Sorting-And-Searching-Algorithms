# Sorting_Algorithms

**Bubble Sort** : This is a simple comparison-based algorithm where the list is repeatedly traversed, and adjacent elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order.

# Searching_Algorithms

    - A search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithm work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated within a search space in a problem domain, with either discrete or continous values.

**1. Sequential or Linear Search**
: Sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list unitl a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

    - A linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most _n_ comparisons, where _n_ is the length of the list. If each element is equally likely to be searched, then linear search has an average case of _(n+1/2)_ comparisons, but the average case can be affected if the search probabilities for each element vary.

    - Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, allow siginificantly faster searching for all but short lists.
